# github-integration package

Some useful UI for GitHub integration in Atom.

This package is currently the default skeleton package, so it doesn't do
anything useful. Check back soon.

This package attempts to recreate some of the UI-based Git and GitHub
integration seen in JetBrains IDEs.

## Planned Features

Many of these features will require a login prompt, which can hopefully be
cached for the duration of the session, but will not be permanently stored.

* **Open from Github:** Get a list of your GitHub repositories and select one
to clone.
* **Share project to Github:** Create a new GitHub repository from the current
window's project files.
* **UI elements for performing regular git tasks.**
    * Including some useful enhancements, such as showing diff panels in commit
    authoring dialog.
